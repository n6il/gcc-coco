Subject: gcc for 68XX

I noticed renewed interest in a version of gcc for Motorola
68XX micros.  I still have a gcc configuration for the 6809
available via ananymous ftp from larry.sal.wisc.edu.  The
directory is /pub/gcc/MC6809 and it contains the usual gcc
configuaration files.  It will take some work to rewrite this
for the MC68HC11, etc. but at least you get to see an example
of a gcc cross-compiler for 8-bit Motorola micros.

I'm looking forward to my next issue of Circuit Cellar Ink.
